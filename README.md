:::How I start USE in windows:::

1) Downlaod the USE tool from https://sourceforge.net/projects/useocl/
2) save the file to a folder you can easily find such as your desktop or a designated course folder
3) Download cygwin64 terminal from https://cygwin.com/install.html
4) Configure cygwin so that the PATH includes the desktop folder (You may need to change environment variables and such so if you need help with this link me)
5) In the cygwin terminal, direct to the folder you saved your USE file
5) Enter cd use-5.1.0 
6) cd bin
7) ./start_use.bat
8) All Set!
